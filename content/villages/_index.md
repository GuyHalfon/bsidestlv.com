# BSidesTLV Villages

Saddle up, partners!

BSidesTLV is striking gold in 2023 with a fresh new take on the wild west of cybersecurity. For the first time in the good, bad, and ugly world of this here rodeo, we're setting up camp with specialized hacker havens, known as "villages". Each settlement will be as unique as a rattlesnake's rattle, focusing on a different aspect of cybersecurity:

Hardware Hacking [Hardware Hacking]({{< ref "/villages/hw_village" >}})

Bug Bounty [Hardware Hacking]({{< ref "/villages/bb_village" >}})

Hello Cyber World! Hacking [Hardware Hacking]({{< ref "/villages/hello_village" >}})
